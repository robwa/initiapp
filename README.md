Web-based organization for initiatives.


## Concept

Most community driven initiatives share the same needs for software:
* They organize themselves as members of an initiative, sometimes within groups.
* Members send messages to other members or groups or all members of the initiative.
* The initiative collects knowledge in some form of editable pages (wiki), possibly sharing some pages with members, groups, other initiatives or the world (kind of a homepage).
* Tasks, todos, events or however you might call them are often a central part of organization as well.

All these parts can be put together with one simple approach: Just append text nodes to the triangle Members/ Groups/ Initiatives. This is the core idea of this project, together with the intent not to reinvent everything from scratch but instead using existing modules as far as possible.


## Development

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/robwa/initiapp.git
cd initiapp
cucumber
```

The output of the last command should give you a good impression of what the current state of development is.
